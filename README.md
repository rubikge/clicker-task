# Practical Task: Clicker Game Enhancement

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
In real-world development, junior developers typically start by contributing to existing projects rather than creating new ones from scratch. This assignment simulates a real work situation where you'll improve an existing project.
Modern AI tools can help understand existing code and identify technologies that require additional learning. However, it's crucial to develop your own understanding of code and its principles. You don't need to fully study the code, but even with basic programming skills, you can solve important tasks.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description
The base project is a clicker game developed using:
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository (main branch only):
```bash
git clone -b main --single-branch https://github.com/rubikge/clicker-task.git
cd clicker-task
```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or if you use yarn
yarn install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or if you use yarn
yarn dev
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

The project should now be running in development mode with hot-reload enabled.

## âœ… Main Tasks

### Basic Interface Improvements
1. Fix the header and shop overlay issue
2. Implement clickable shop elements
3. Add tooltips when hovering over shop items

### Creative Development
Choose one of the following development paths:

#### Option 1: Unique Game Mechanics
- Create your own game theme (examples: car upgrades, YouTube channel growth, crypto mining)
- Select appropriate visual assets and background
- Implement button skin changes when reaching new levels
- Add original boosters and mechanics:
  - Location changes
  - Cooldown-based boosters
  - Custom game mechanics

#### Option 2: Design Enhancement
- Implement design according to Figma mockup
- Optimize and structure TailwindCSS styles
- Improve user interface

## ðŸš€ Further Development Options
- Backend development for progress saving in MongoDB
- Achievement system implementation
- Multiplayer functionality

## ðŸ’¡ Note
While modern AI tools can help understand existing code and identify technologies requiring deeper study, it's essential to develop your own understanding of code and its working principles.

## ðŸ›  Technical Requirements
- Node.js
- npm/yarn
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
